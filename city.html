                <p id="par">Herat is an ancient city in western Afghanistan, with several ruins and historical places of interest, such as the Herat Citadel or the Mausoleum of Queen Goharshad. The Friday Mosque has been started as early as the year 1,200 AD and was completed throughout the centuries. Today the Great Mosque complex still preserves some of its original decoration even if the majority has been replaced with newer works. Behind the main entrance there is a craftsmen’s shop where you can witness artisans at work, cutting tiles, working the mosaic and laying out the new pieces.</p>
