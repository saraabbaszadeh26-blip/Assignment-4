                <p>Afghanistan is a historically blended country, at the crossroads of multiple peoples and cultures, from the Silk Road to the Soviet invasion. Diverse due to its history, this landlocked country has some beautiful cities, full of historic monuments of cultural importance. From Jalalabad in the eastern part to Balkh in the northern part, here are Afghanistan’s most beautiful cities.</p>

                <h2>Kabul</h2>
                <p>The capital of Afghanistan and the country’s largest city, Kabul has a millenary history, as it exists for more than 3,500 years. Some of the city’s attractive sites are the Abdul Rahman Mosque, the Afghan National Museum and the historic park, Gardens of Babur. The Rahman Mosque is fairly new, having been inaugurated in 2012, but it is built in traditional islamic architectural style, with 14 domes and two minarets.</p>

                <h2>Balkh</h2>
                Considered one of the oldest cities in the world, Balkh in northern Afghanistan was named by the Arabs ‘The Mother of Cities.’ At the crossroads between eastern Asia and the Middle East, Balkh was heavily influenced by the Buddhist culture before the Arab invasion. The ancient ruins of the city include Buddhist constructions and fortifications evoking the old Asian culture. Other places of interest are the ruins of the Green Mosque and the Nine Domes Mosque, an exquisitely ornamented place added on the World Monuments watch list as an endangered cultural site.

                <h2>Herat</h2>
                Herat is an ancient city in western Afghanistan, with several ruins and historical places of interest, such as the Herat Citadel or the Mausoleum of Queen Goharshad. The Friday Mosque has been started as early as the year 1,200 AD and was completed throughout the centuries. Today the Great Mosque complex still preserves some of its original decoration even if the majority has been replaced with newer works. Behind the main entrance there is a craftsmen’s shop where you can witness artisans at work, cutting tiles, working the mosaic and laying out the new pieces.
